About 6 hours total.

None, we didn't run into too many problems.

We tested our program with different string lengths and each of us reviewed eachothers code to ensure it met all the specifications.
5. What parts of your code could use improvement or disappointed you (what work didnâ€™t you get done, that more time would have enabled you to finish, or what bugs did you not resolve)?
The only issue we could think of is to have functions that flow a bit better together and are more relatent to eachother.

All of it.
